# SkillCraft Technology Task 1

# Responsive Landing Page

## Description

This project is a responsive landing page created as Task-01 for my internship at SkillCraft Technologies. The landing page features an interactive navigation menu that changes color or style when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item. The navigation menu has a fixed position and is visible on all pages.

- **CSS**: Used for styling the page.
- **JavaScript**: Used to add interactivity, such as changing the background color or font color of the menu when it is scrolled or when a menu item is hovered over.
- **Bootstrap**: Used to ensure responsiveness.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The landing page is fully responsive, making it accessible and visually appealing on various devices and screen sizes.
- **Interactive Navigation Menu**: The navigation menu changes color or style based on user interaction (scrolling or hovering).
- **Fixed Navigation**: The navigation menu is fixed and remains visible as the user scrolls through the page.
